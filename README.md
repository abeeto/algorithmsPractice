# My Algorithms/Leetcode Practice

This repository will comprise of my own implementations of algorithms, abstract data types and structures. I hope to track my progress and also try programming challenges from Leetcode. My hope is that by tracking my progress on this repo I will be able to encourage myself to keep going and improve.

- leetcode solutions

- data structures implementations
    - stacks
    - (priority) queues
    - lists: linked and unlinked
- implementing algorithms:
    - recursion/divide and conquer
    - greedy algorithms 
        - prim
        - kruskal 
        - djikstra
        - interval scheduling
        - interval partitioning
    - dynamic programming and memoization
